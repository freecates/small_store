SmallStore converts a list of products into a complete eCommerce site. It generates static HTML files, and uses a javascript shopping cart. It calculates tax and shipping based on product configs, and gives the customer the option to pay with PayPal or Google Checkout.

It supports just about any templating engine you want (using Tilt), and it will compile coffeescript for you, too.

It was written for http://www.creativeretrospection.com, and you can see it in action there.

To get your own site up and running, check out the examples under config/. You'll need to have:

 * config/sections.rb
 * config/products/something.rb
 * config/about_me.rb
 * config/google_analytics_account.rb

There's not much documentation yet. Check out small_store.rb if you want to go code spelunking.

This project is being developed with features specific to www.creativeretrospection.com in mind, but if you want to contribute, feel free to drop me a pull request (rather than a feature request). :)

Much thanks to wojodesign for his really nice JS shopping cart (https://github.com/wojodesign/simplecart-js).

Upcoming features:

 * Resize images for the various sizes required
 * minify javascript, CSS
 * use something better than straight-up CSS
